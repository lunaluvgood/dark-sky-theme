# Recent updates

Version 0.1.0 is here! This version brings a big overhaul to the details in the UI. The UI is now a lot more consistent and has a more consistent accent color. For the list of changes look at the changelog.

# Personal Note

I have developed this theme with the intention of using it for Python, however it does work for other programming languages. I will continue to update the theme. For future plans please look at the changelog.

Thank you for giving this theme a try.
